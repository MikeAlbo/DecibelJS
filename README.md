# decibel_mockup
a mockup seed project for the decibel open source project

## future ideas

### auto file type detection
1. a function or regex will test the 3 characters in the string and test them against a set of known types
2. if the type is supported by the current browser, then it will be passed to the build phase
3. else, it will be passed and a warning will be displayed
